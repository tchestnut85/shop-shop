## Description
Tomazon is a full-stack MERN E-commerce app. Users can register an account, view all products or categories of products on the homepage, choose to view a single product in detail, and add items to their cart. Users can also change the quantity or remove items in their cart, as well as checkout to purchase their items (using fake data as these are not real products and the checkout functionality is in test mode). Once the checkout process is completed, the user is redirected to the homepage. This app also supports offline functionality to save their cart details in case they lose their internet connection. In that case, their cart items will still be saved.

This app uses the full MERN stack as well as a GraphQL API with Apollo Server to interact with the database. Redux is also used to manage the global state of the app's products, cart and checkout functionality.
